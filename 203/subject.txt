This is a small school math project dealing with Binomial and Poisson distribution.
It is fun to constate the huge computation time distance between these two.

Here is the subject:

Uncle Luigi runs a 25-phone-hotline in Pondichéry.
He reckons 3500 people could possibly call each day (8 hours), and would like to know the probability of overload
(that is, the probability no line is available), depending on the average duration of calls.

Here you got a mission.

The random variable representing the number of people calling at a given time follows the binomial distribution,
whereas calls are independant from each others.
This program could be reuse to a larger scale, so you fear the computation of the binomial distribution may be timeconsuming,
and you consider to approximate it with a Poisson distribution ; how smart.
You have then to program a software to attest this, by :

• compute the binomial coefficient n given k and n (emphasizing the computation speed and stack optimization),

• compare binomial and Poisson distributions given the average duration of calls, printing
– the probabilities to get n simultaneous calls (for n increasing from 0 to 50),
– the probability of overload,
– the computation time.
