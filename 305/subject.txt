In the construction industry, the foreman is the person who manages, among other things, the scheduling of a construction
site, and who also plans when contractors will intervene (which can be frequently). In order to do this, they
have software that uses all the methods of operational research.
You must create a project’s software that helps organize construction, based on the MPM method: starting from a file
that describes all of the project’s tasks, you will display the following:
• total duration of construction,
• the earliest and latest dates for each task,
• a Gantt diagram that specifies intervals of fluctuation.
